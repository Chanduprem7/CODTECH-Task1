### Project Overview:

This project is a To-Do List web application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add tasks with specific due dates and visually tracks the progress of task completion through a dynamic progress bar. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a clean, user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and monitoring tasks.

#### Key Features:

1. **Task Input and Date Selection**: Users can enter tasks with a title and select a due date, making it easy to keep track of deadlines.
   
2. **Add Task Button**: With the "Add Task" button, users can easily add tasks to the list.
3. **Progress Tracker**: A progress bar shows the percentage of completed tasks, which is updated automatically based on the number of tasks marked as complete.
4. **Interactive List**: The task list displays all active tasks, making it simple for users to view, update, or remove tasks as needed.
